Hello, Spartans!

This is the first build release of HaloTAS, a set of tools for building a tool-assisted speedrun of Halo: Combat Evolved.


To Install HaloTAS:
1. copy TASDLL.dll to your Halo\CONTROLS folder
2. copy the HaloTASFiles folder to your Halo\ folder

To Uninstall HaloTAS:
1. Delete TASDLL.dll from your Halo\CONTROLS folder


Please be aware there are still bugs, crashes, desyncs, and other various tomfoolery associated with the tools. If you experience any of these, please create an issue on the HaloTAS github and I will work on resolving it. Always use the search first to see if your issue already exists!

Before reporting a problem, make sure you meet the following requirements:

1. Operating System: Windows 10. It's what I'm using, and it's the more convenient if we can rule out OS issues. You can still report an issue but I will not be able to test on anything other than Win10.
2. Use a retail copy of Halo updated to 01.00.10.0621. Many things are hard-coded to support only this version of the game. Custom Edition, pirated copies, and older patches of the game are not supported and will not work.
